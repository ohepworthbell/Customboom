# Customboom

This is a basic, customisable, vanilla-JavaScript version of the retro Kaboom! game.

### About the game

It's a simple game of catch. A single ball will drop at a time, and a player will move a tin can back and forth to catch the ball. Each catch will increase the score, and each miss will lose a life until all lives are lost. The game is written in JavaScript and the HTML5 <canvas> tag; is intended to be very basic and heavily customisable; and work on IE9+ and all versions of Edge, Chrome, Firefox and Safari.

### Current features

* HTML5 canvas and pure vanilla-JS - no dependencies
* Almost everything can be easily customised
* Ball speed increases over time, and resets when a life is lost
* Starting lives can be set to arbitrary value
* Area of play and canvas width/height can be changed - game area stretches to fit
* The game is responsive and smartphone/touch-friendly


### Urgent to-do list

* Ability to pause on mobile devices
* Restart button to re-initialise game on Game Over
* Overlay 'scores' and 'lives remaining' onto canvas and style them
* Add points systems for different balls (i.e. gold balls = 5 points, gray balls = lose a point)


### Possible future additions

* Background animation in future? Would this cause frame-rate issues?
* Extra lives occasionally fall, same time as ball but slower so they can be caught
* Add in table-top graphic (with width calculation to edge of play)
* Ability to add sounds
* Improve external customisability - calculate can size from image, rather than pre-set?
* Bonus lives (fall slowly, allow a player to restock lives)
* Share scores on gameover screen
* More intuitive image/colour customisation
* Any other suggestions
